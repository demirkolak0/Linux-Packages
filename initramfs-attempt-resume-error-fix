The initramfs will attempt to resume from /dev/nvme0n1p2..Set the RESUME variable

Error:
update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-6.1.0-18-amd64
I: The initramfs will attempt to resume from /dev/nvme0n1p2
I: (UUID=*in this part it give you a uuid copy that*)
I: Set the RESUME variable to override this.



The solution is to add the UUID to this file:
/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume
using the following command: (change the uuid to your own uuid on your output)
Code:
echo "RESUME=*and paste it here i think u understand that lol*" | sudo tee /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume
Then update the kernels on the system:
Code:
sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
Reboot the system:
Code:
reboot
